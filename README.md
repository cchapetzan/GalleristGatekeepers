# GalleristGatekeepers

“GalleristGatekeepers.com” was born with a specific purpose: bring exclusive and different contemporary artwork out-side the USA-EU axis. People are really engaged in art and want to support that as much as they can.

The idea starts by researching on other sites dedicated to the art world and realising how most of them were disconnected to the real audience (people who want to consume and understand art - not just put in on the wall).

As art-lovers we missed museums, exhibitions and during the Pandemic, we saw many failed attempts by some museums and galleries to promote art online with virtual exhibitions, for example.
