			<p><i>“Rethinking shapes; rethink the connections."</i> With that phrase in hes head and tickets to fly far away from her home, Miss Wei, or WWW as she prefers to be called, decided to start the studies that gave rise to the exclusive paints that this gallery brings to you.</p>
			<p>Born in China, but raised in Taiwan, WWW represents in her art the perfect union of her father's creative euphoria (the audacious Ai Wei Wei), with the disconnection of the symbol and its meaning, giving vent to the fluid forms in its oils on canvas. </p>
			<p>According to the artist, these are imperative representations of human relations today: colorful yet fleeting.</p>
			<p>Between 2016-2019 Wendy Wei produced a series entitled <i> “Flowing Lighter: Unique Identities Dancing or F.L.U.I.D.” </i>, where, in the author's words, the intention was to represent the joy and ethereal encounter of human being on earth.</p>
			<p>However, those are pandemic times and there is no celebration, except the virtual one. So, to complement this series of special paints, WWW produced something unique, a sculpture entitled <i>“Time: is there still?” </i> which will be available for our members to bid at our next virtual auction.</p>
