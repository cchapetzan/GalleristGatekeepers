			<p>Just like in “Alice in the Wonderland” our artist knows that 2020 is ending and wants to celebrate the rush that 2021 promises for the resumption of life as it was BEFORE the pandemic.</p>
			<p>The sculpture has a copper and aluminum frame (also removed from unused computers) as well as a fully functional solar powered watch.</p>
			<p><i>"How long is Forever?"</i> will be auctioned on 01.21.2021 by our official virtual auction channel with Christie's live audit.</p>
			<p>This is undoubtedly an excellent opportunity for our art buyers to acquire a unique piece with a very special meaning.</p>
			<p>The virtual auction will be made available via video-conference only to “Platinum” members of GG.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in becoming a “Platinum” member, click on the button below to send an evaluation proposal by email.</p>
			<input class="styledb" type="button" value="I would like to join" onclick="alertauc()">
			<p>See you at the auction!</p>
